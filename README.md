# iTrack Macros
Latest project on the appstore for tracking your daily macro intake

This project end to end was completed and added to the appstore in just under a week. I wanted to see
what the process looked like for using SwiftUI. Some new features will be added such as adding favourite meals
& recipes. Along with social interaction with other users who use the app.
